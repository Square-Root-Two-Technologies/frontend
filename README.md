Find a 'New Ticket' you find interesting from the Project Board, and ask to be assigned.

Once assigned, create a new branch off main named with the issue number and the ticket name formatted as follows:

"IssueNumber-name-of-ticket"
Example: 14-post-request-to-database-for-articles
Work on your branch, commit and push when necessary. Be descriptive and clear with your commit messages.

Once finished, create a pull request to merge into the main branch. The pull request should properly fill out the PR template.

An admin will review your ticket, and either approve your changes, or request changes. If changes requested, checkout to your branch and make requested changes.

Note: Code will be thoroughly reviewed - we uphold a code quality standard at NU Sci:

You will be asked to explain your reasoning to be approved.
You must have proper and clear formatting on all changes in the code.
You must not have extraneous code / code not relevant to the ticket in the pull request.
The code must be well-documented and commented.
The code must conform to the design patterns and choices already existing in the code.
The code must pass all tests, as well as have new tests defined for new or adjusted functionality.
It often requires multiple rounds of review in order for a pull request to be merged.
